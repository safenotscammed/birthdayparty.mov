# Watch Out for .mov Domains!

If you clicked on birthdayparty.mov in a message or email someone sent you and ended up here instead of watching a video, you might be wondering what's going on. Let me explainâ€¦

Starting from May 2023, anyone can create a website ending in .mov. This can create confusion because some services automatically add clickable links when you enter a domain name. 

So if your friend sends you a video of their birthday party and says "Here's the video from my party last week: birthdayparty.mov," their messaging service may automatically convert "birthdayparty.mov" into a clickable link. When you read it, you might click the link instead of the attachment, thinking it will just download the file for you. Instead, it directs you here.

Bad actors can abuse this by creating malicious .mov websites in the hopes that users like you will go there by mistake. For example, they can create a site that automatically downloads malware, or they may try to trick you into entering your personal details.

So now you know! Stay safe out there!
